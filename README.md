# Just Intonation Generator
This project is a simple Python script  that generates and lists musical note frequencies based on the Just Intonation tuning system. While most modern music uses Equal Temperament, Just Intonation offers a unique, harmonically pure sound. This tool allows you to explore that sound by generating accurate frequencies for any given key within the audible range.

# Features
- Just Intonation Scale Generation: Calculates the frequencies of a 12-note major scale for a given root note.
- Auduible Range Expansion: Expands the scale frequencies to cover the full audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz) across multiple octaves.

# Why Just Intonation?
Just Intonation uses simple whole-number ratios to define the relationships between notes in a scale. Unlike Equal Temperament, which compromises perfect harmony for consistent tuning across all keys, Just Intonation provides a richer, more resonant quality to chords and intervals. This script offers a way to mathematically explore the beauty of this tuning system.
